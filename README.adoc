= About the macros branch =

https://github.com/OlivierNicole/ocaml/tree/macros_unstable[macros_unstable] is
merged into https://github.com/OlivierNicole/ocaml/tree/macros[macros] on a
regular basis, once a set of changes has been applied and the tests run.

== Overview

This is an experimental implementation of OCaml macros, originally designed by
Leo White and Jeremy Yallop:

http://www.lpw25.net/papers/ocaml2015-abs1.pdf

You can find a summary of the current progress here:

http://otini.chnik.fr/posts/2017-01-06-modular-macros.html

This branch is based on version 4.04 of OCaml.

== Installation

Installation instruction are the same as for the standard OCaml distribution.
You can find a few examples of what is possible in the links above. You can also
take a look at the `testsuite/tests/macros/` directory.

=== Installing OPAM packages

Most packages should compile fine, but causes that may break your packages
include:

* a use of the reserved words `static` or `macro` as an identifier;
* a use of `$` as a regular operator.

If you need to install Camlp4, you will have to pin it to
https://github.com/OlivierNicole/camlp4[this repository]. Please be aware that
this version of Camlp4 is only provided for backward-compatibility and can only
generate "pre-macro" OCaml, i.e. it cannot generate any of the macro constructs.

== Contributing

You are very welcome to try out macros. Please do report any bugs or
inconvenience by opening an issue on this repo.

=== Pull requests

Found a bug and know how to fix it? We certainly appreciate pull requests.
If you plan on making big changes, please file an issue first to discuss why
theses changes are needed.

== Limitations / To Do

Things to be done sorted by descending priority:

* Support for declaring static type extensions (including static exceptions)
* Solve issues of static linking and side effects, possibly by banning the
  `static` keyword
* Upgrade of `ocamldep` to take into account the modifications in dependency
  trees because of the above
* Fix GADT matching in quotations
